**about**

[ADILOS (A Digital Lock System)](https://github.com/bitsanity/ADILOS) is a
protocol that provides a way for someone to prove ownership of a cryptographic
key. The proof is done by performing a message exchange in which a
cryptographic challenge is presented and a response is returned.

If the response is correct then the exchange proves that the responder truly
holds the public key included in the response.
